# Dotfiles Setup

This repository contains my personal dotfiles configuration for various tools and applications on Linux. The configuration was originally set up on an **Arch Linux** system and is tailored for **Wayland**, **Hyprland**, **Ghostty**, and other tools like **Neovim**, **Spicetify**, **Waybar**, and **Starship**.
